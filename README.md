# Global Blockchain Security & Advanced Journey

Welcome to my blockchain journey repository. Here you will find all my challenges, smart contracts, and projects developed to improve my skills in Solidity, React, TypeScript, and advanced blockchain security concepts.

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a challenge or project:

- **Challenge_01_AdvancedCalculator**: Advanced calculator smart contract with testing.
- **Challenge_02_QTA_Token**: Custom ERC20 token implementation with deployment scripts.
- **Challenge_03_SenderPro**: Smart contract to send tokens and ETH securely.
- **Challenge_04_React_TypeScript_Wallet_Connector**: React + TypeScript project connecting to MetaMask wallets.
- **Challenge_05_CryptoBank**: Advanced smart contract to deposit and withdraw ETH and ERC20 tokens, includes screenshots and README.

## How to Explore

- Each challenge folder contains:
  - The smart contract code (`.sol`) or project source.
  - README explaining the challenge, steps, and outputs.
  - Screenshots to illustrate functionality (if any).

## Purpose

This repository is a personal learning journey focused on:

- Solidity and smart contract development
- Multi-chain wallet interactions
- React + TypeScript front-end integration
- Security best practices in blockchain
