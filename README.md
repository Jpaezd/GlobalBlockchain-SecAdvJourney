This repository showcases my **progressive Web3 development journey**, specifically the evolution of a **wallet connection using React and TypeScript** with MetaMask.  

I structured the project in **two stages**:

- **Basic version** – Fundamental MetaMask connection, beginner-friendly.  
- **PRO version** – Production-ready wallet integration with lifecycle handling, safety checks, and advanced architecture.

Each stage is documented separately to highlight my **technical growth** and **best practices in Web3 frontends**.
